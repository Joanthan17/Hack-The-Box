# Hack-The-Box
Repo for my HTB writeups and tools i've been using.

* "boxes" - files and tools i've used during the box
* "Writeups" - md files (with their corresponding folder for screenshots) of the solutions
* "tools" - most recent 'general CTF' tools i have

P.S:
'Writeups' is a bit messed-up with the md / folder names since im using notion app for notetaking and thats the way notion exports its notes.
